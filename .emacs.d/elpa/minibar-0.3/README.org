#+title: Minibar - Modular status bar in minibuffer

The echo area is unused most of the time.  Sometimes this empty area
so annoying that some people want to get rid of it.  This package
makes it useful by showing a status bar in it when it's unused.  This
is especially helpful when you use Emacs as your X window manager
using EXWM.
